# My Meditations on Moloch

```
Same as it ever was, we go about our days.
We pledge allegiance to the dollar and the republic for which it stands.
Hammers and sickles, and stars and stripes, and crescent moons.
Our lives enact the algorithms of a jealous god.

Moloch, failure of coordination and victory of the status quo.
Moloch who sets interest rates and the price of a soul.
Moloch, the reason we hurt each other.
Moloch who owns the banks and the factories and the politicians and pits them against each other like prisoners in a dilemma.

Unwittingly, we serve the machine.
A free agent, the charity and its cause.
The specter who poisons the well and sells the cure.
The red cross and all of its henchmen and tax beneficiaries.

What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open our skulls and ate up our brains and imagination?
Moloch, whose eyes are a thousand mirrors, blind to your suffering!
Smash them! Jab them out!
Let us see if Moloch truly bleeds oil. Let us see if steel can burn.

The vampire cannot enter your home uninvited, but can certainly trick you.
The markets fold, the monkey's paw curls. What will you do when the machine breaks down?
For food? For water? For shelter? For love? Can you help your neighbor? Can you help yourself?
Don't. Let. Moloch. In.
